Hello Everybody,
The official documentation for this release lies below.

The changes established in this release are:
> creation and update of framework and structure of the project 
from dash dash to sustain framework
> improved overall integrity and flexibility of the project.
> improved versatility by employing a better file structure

To use // innovateCLI 0.5.4 sustain///:
you must:

> run setup.py
> follow all instructions such as specifying the gemini api key.
> restart your shell or create a new one  
> use the 'innovate' command to run the cli successfully


To use // innovateCLI 0.5.4 sustain/// as a framework or library
> use this as a folder structure
> from ./src/innovate.py and import it in a python file. (your directory may differ, but generaly at C:/innovate)

Quickstart:
from [directory-of-zip] import Innovate
engine = Innovate(GEMINI-API-KEY)
engine.ascii("my very own innovatecli integration in python!")
while True:
    query = input("? ").strip()
    engine.generate(query)

Notes:
As of now the projects generated are at the source codes projects/ directory.
Further flexibility will be added in the next subversion.
The sustain framework will be updated in the future and will be the main means of using innovate CLI.
This framework was made so that you and even us can implement the cli's actual code in a flexible manner such as for the creation of WI.
The innovateWI (Web Interface) will be launching soon!
